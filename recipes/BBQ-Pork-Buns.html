        <li>Â½ cup char siu sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>

        <li>sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the dough, mix together the dry ingredients. Make a well in the centre pour in the water and the oil.
            Mix with a wooden spoon until a dough starts to form. Then use your hands to knead the dough for 10 minutes
            or until the dough is smooth and springy to the touch. Place the dough in a large bowl and cover. Allow to
            rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, for the filling, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add
            the onion and garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until softened. Then add the Chinese BBQ
            pork, char siu sauce, soy sauce, sugar and water. Mix well and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Then stir through the
            cornflour mixture. Simmer for a further minute or until the filling is very thick. Remove from heat and
            spread the mixture out on a tray. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes to cool down.</li>
        <li>Take the dough and on a floured surface, roll into out into a rough rectangle, then fold the dough in half
            and roll out again. Repeat another 2 times. Then roll up into a cylinder and cut the dough into 16 pieces
            (the sides will have a spiral pattern due to the folding). Flatten a piece of dough with your palm. Then use
            a rolling pin to roll the edges so that they are thinner than the centre of the dough disc (similar to
            dumpling wrapper). Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.</li>
        <li>Take a disc of dough and place 2 heaped tablespoons of filling in the centre. Pleat the dough edges up and
            around the filling to completely enclose. Place the bun on a tray lined with baking paper. Repeat with the
            remaining dough and filling. Cover with a damp tea towel and rest for 1 hour in a warm place.</li>
        <li>Place the buns in a steamer and cook over boiling water for 10 minutes or until the dough is fluffy and
            cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
